##Decorator Design Pattern

Decorator adds new functionality to individual objects dynamically and transparently.

### Short description

It's a flexible alternative to subclussing. It represents a "light" version of Strategy Pattern which changes not only an object's look but also
its main algorithm.

### Plain description

Using a decorator we can add to an object a new functionality dynamically without affecting it. We can make a chain of changes that will
add different "views/skins" to it.
